Online Video sharing and a platform to invest on content creators
----

## Problem  
YouTube pays only 25% of ad revenue to content creators
"Majority of the revenue is shared among 0.25 % of the channels." - UK Based YouTube Expert Alan Spicer
It therefore is a very saturated market, with only a very small percentage of people having any monetary reason to stay in it.

## Solution  
What about treating the channels as an entity that has value and treat it as a stock? If the viewer thinks highly of a channel's potential, he/she can invest using our currency in the channel and it is treated as a stock so profit/loss depends on that. The creator himself gets a fixed income based on his stock's value.It's business model is scalable by a lot and both the creators and viewers get monetary gain apart from the entertainment value.
